Notable things learned in this project (html):
I learned how to use transitions to smoothly move objects and that there is a
LOT of flexibility in these options.

I still don't really understand Flex Box but between the start files and
trial and error and some absolute positioning it all worked out.

I don't have a lot to say about the HTML so I'll put it here that I pulled the
astronomical data from https://sunrise-sunset.org/us/wichita-ks/2025/12 and used my python
skills to print out a huge JS object that I could refer to. (see the data.js file)
